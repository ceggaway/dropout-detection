## Implementation Plan: Defining and Identifying Poor Performance

To classify at-risk users, we define poor performance using two key factors: engagement score and grade performance.

We also used Pearson correlation and found a strong positive relationship between engagement and grade (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001).
This validates the use of both metrics in detecting dropout risk.

### 1. Engagement score

Definition: A learner is considered to have low engagement if their combined interaction score is less than 4.
classification tool: composite score + rule based calculation
statistical tool : median, histogram
Engagement Score Formula: engagement_score = num_event + num_video + num_chap + num_post


Justification:
Combines multiple behavioral signals into one interpretable metric
The median engagement score was 4, and the histogram shows that most users score below 10
A threshold of < 4 captures the bottom 50% of learners in terms of platform interaction

-- view to calculate composite engagement scores
CREATE view view_engagement_score AS
SELECT
    user_id,
    course_id,
    COALESCE(num_event, 0) + COALESCE(num_video, 0) + COALESCE(num_chap, 0) + COALESCE(num_post, 0) AS engagement_score
FROM engagement;

-- Approximate the 50th percentile (median)
SELECT engagement_score
FROM view_engagement_score
ORDER BY engagement_score
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 344213; --(688427 / 2)

--conclusion :Learners with engagement_score < 4 are considered to have low engagement, based on median and histogram analysis.



/*
### 2. Performance Logic
Definition: A learner is considered to have low performance if their grade is below 0.5.
statistical tool : median, hypothesis testing ( T-test), boxplot

Justification:
Grade is a continuous value from 0.0 to 1.0
Median grade = 0.0, indicating that at least half of learners did not achieve any measurable success
T-test result: T = -91.51, p < 0.0001 â€” strongly supports that the grade < 0.5 group differs significantly
The boxplot visually confirms the skew and failure clustering

CREATE view low_performance_users AS
SELECT
    user_id,
    course_id,

FROM enrollment
where grade is not null;

SELECT grade
FROM low_performance_users

LIMIT 1 OFFSET 319368; -- 638736/2

--result : 0

--Conclusion: Learners with grade < 0.5 are considered to have low performance, supported by median, boxplot, and t-test.
